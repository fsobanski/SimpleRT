# SimpleRT
Reverse [Tethering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) utility for Android.

Allows you to share your computer's internet connection with your Android device via a USB cable.

Development is still in progress, bugs and errors can occur.

```
IMPORTANT!
   If you have any issues with this tool, please, provide some logs:
   - run util in debug mode (-d), connect your device
   - run "ip addr show"
   - run "ip route show"
   - store this output into issue ticket on github
```

```
FIRST RUN: check out -h option!
   simple-rt -h
   usage: sudo ./simple-rt [-h] [-i interface] [-n nameserver|"local" ]
   default params: -i eth0 -n 8.8.8.8
```

### No root, no adb required!

## Full Linux and macOS support! Windows version is in early researching.

   Current version features:
   - Multi-tether. You can connect several android devices into one virtual network!
   - DNS server specifying (custom or system one).

The SimpleRT utility consists of 2 parts:

- Android part:

   Implemented as standalone service, no gui, no activities. Simplicity!

   Dependencies:
   - Android 4.0 and higher.

   Build system based on gradle + gradle experimental android plugin (supporting ndk). For build you need both sdk & ndk.
Create local.properties file in root dir, it should be looking like that:
   ```
   ndk.dir=/home/viper/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle
   sdk.dir=/home/viper/Android/Sdk
   ```
   build:
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk is your apk.

- Desktop part:

   Dependencies:
   - libusb-1.0
   - libresolv (usually already present in both linux and macos)
   - tuntap kernel module (linux version), utun (macos version, builtin)

   before build (debian based example):
   ```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev
   ```

   Makefile is universal for all platforms, just type make.

Usage:

- run console util as root
- connect your android device

First connection requires some trivial steps:

![Third step](screens/connected.png)

Issues: Some apps do not recognize the reverse tethered internet connection due to ConnectivityManager policy. Just leave WiFi or 3g connection active, connection will go through SimpleRT anyway.
